# Minimization
This project involves carrying out a study on minimization, which is a randomization method.
Randomization is a statistical process in which a random mechanism assigns subjects to different groups.
It is widely used in the field of health and clinical health care.
The aim of randomization is to guarantee balance within each group, to enable group comparability, while remaining unpredictable.

The aim is to compare the minimization of Pocock SJ, Simon R (1975) with a simple randomization method.

Simple randomization consists in assigning each patient treatment A or B with equal probabilities (0.5).
Although this method is unpredictable and reduces bias, it remains highly unbalanced.

Minimization is an iterative, adaptive method that calculates group allocation in real time.
Treatment is allocated by minimizing the imbalance between groups.
It guarantees a balance between groups, which is particularly effective in small samples.

In order to compare the results of these two methods, it will be relevant to study :
